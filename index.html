						<p><b>R1: A Handmade Web</b><br />
							 
							
							<a href="http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html">A Handmade Web by J.R Carpenter</a><br><br />
							
							What is the thesis of this article?<br><br />

							This article's thesis centres on the idea of the "handmade web," which is defined as an era of the internet that evolved in the mid- to late-1990s. The phrase "handmade web" refers to websites that are coded by individuals as instead of relying on software or corporate entities. These websites defy conventional norms and showcase a more subjective, experimental, and transitory method of web design and content generation. By comparing this homemade web to physical handmade products like zines, pamphlets, and artists' books, the paper examines its qualities and relevance. The author highlights the social, cultural, and historical environment in which the handmade web was created, emphasising its mutually beneficial relationship with print and its capacity to fight off the internet's escalating commercialization and standardisation. The handmade web promotes continued participation in developing web pages and policies as a form of protest against the increasingly corporate and standardised nature of the modern web. In the midst of the highly commercialised digital landscape, it calls for a return to slowness, smallness, and uniqueness and embraces the concrete, practical, and DIY components of web development. <br><br />

							Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?<br><br />

							The "handmade web," as Carpenter refers to it, is portrayed as a form of resistance against the current internet's escalating commercialisation, standardisation, and depersonalization. It is a backlash against the move towards a heavily commercialised internet dominated by big businesses, proprietary software, read-only computers, search engines, content management systems, WYSIWYG editors, and online publishers. <br><br />


								Here are the key aspects being resisted:<br><br />

								<ol>

									<li>Commercialization: Aims to prevent the internet from being taken over by big corporations and profit-driven interests.</li>

									<li>Standardization: Web design and content that is handmade are encouraged to be distinctive and different.</li>

									<li>Depersonalization and Loss of Ownership: Retaining personal control and ownership over one's online identity.</li>

									<li>Erosion of DIY and Community Spirit: The struggle to preserve the DIY ethos and the early web's sense of a tight-knit, community-focused environment.</li>
								</ol>
								<br><br />


							In conclusion, the handmade web is a protest against the loss of the original qualities of the internet, such as creativity, individual participation, and community-driven projects, which have been overshadowed by corporate dominance and standardisation in the current digital landscape.<br><br />

							Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the "physicality" of the web?<br><br />
						
							Based on my own experiences, here are some examples I thought of:<br><br />

							<ol>


								<li>Digital Art Installations: Both in OCAD and outside art exhibitions, I've seen digital art installation that draw a lot of attention and require immense effort.</li>

								<li>Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): VR and AR technologies immerse users in digital environments, providing a sense of physical presence and interaction within virtual spaces, enhancing the sensory and spatial perception of the web. As a gamer who has tried VR, it is incredibly fun and interesting to understand how it works.</li>

								<li>Kinetic Typography and Interactive Typography: Designs that utilize moving or interactive text. As an advertising student who has worked with typography but is interested in motion graphics and intricate advertisements, kinetic or moving typography has always interested me and is quite fun to learn as well.</li>

								<li>3D Printing and Digital Fabrication: The integration of 3D printing and digital fabrication technologies, where digital designs are translated into physical objects, bridging the gap between the virtual and physical world. I personally have not tried 3D printing yet, but it has always make me very intrigued and I'd love to learn and understand the mechanics behind it.</li>

								<li>Digital Music and Electronic Instruments: Electronic instruments and music production software that simulate traditional musical instruments, allowing musicians to create digital sounds in an expressive and interactive manner. Music is something that is very important to me and therefore I tried learning digital music with FL Studio and it's so interested how we can now mimic music without having to learn instruments.</li><br><br />

	These examples showcase the efforts to enhance the physicality of the web, blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical realms, and providing a more immersive and tangible experience for users.
