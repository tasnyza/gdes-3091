                    When I got to know I got show/hide, I researched on it and only found things like show/hide password using Javascript.

                  The concept of show/hide using javascript seemed so weird to me because technically <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp">this link</a> only showed it properly but we can show/hide in any way.
                  While thinking of an idea for a really long time, I came up with something very complicated like clicking stars to show an hourglass and then present a motivational line.

                  I was doing this with p5.js because I used it earlier in a different course, but it was very hard to implement and I got to know you can't do clicking animations in p5.js (not sure). I later showed my progress to my professor, Peter and he felt like the outcome was too predicatable, so I changed gears. I thought of a different idea I got from a tiktok I saw long ago (which I couldn't find anymore), and it was about two people who were soulmates in every life.

                I initially wanted to do it with pixel art but I couldn't figure out how to make it in p5.js, So I drew it out in Figma.

                With the help of these other p5.js works:

                    <li>https://editor.p5js.org/tasnimahh/sketches/7-vrBfbC1</li>
                    <li>https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/DmcJX_3pg</li>
                </ul>

                I was able to figure out how to use resize in p5.js, I was unable to figure out how to draw the flower so I had to simplify it.

                There were also other things I wanted to implement like the sky changing but I ran out of time.
