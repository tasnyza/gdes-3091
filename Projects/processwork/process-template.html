                    I was thinking about what kind of an index to make for a very long time, initially, I wanted to do something very ambition, but because of my lack of confidence in my coding skills, I shifted to looking at old index designs at Dribbble.

                    During that same week, I was also working on my game in Game Engines course. During our final presentation, a girl presentated a game with a pink aesthetic and it stayed in my head, with my new C# skills, I was thinking of making a game like website where a player moves like Super Mario and when he hits the clouds, it will trigger the animations that leads the user to my work. But it was way too hard to implement using simply code and not a game engine like I did in that other class. Following that idea, I made this layout for the website.

                    It was a very pretty idea, but I wasn't in love with it. So I thought of more ideas, at the end my final two ideas were a bubble tea kiosk (inspiration: https://lucy3751.github.io/Interactive-Media-Web/index-land.html) and a visual novel (inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6obsZ97wVOE). I decided to go with the latter because of how fun the idea seemed.

                    This idea had the same problem: I knew how to implement it using a game engine and not just code, so the tricky part was figuring that out. After a lot of research, I found this website
